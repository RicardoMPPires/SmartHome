# Welcome to My SmartHome Project!

Discover the future of home automation with our SmartHome Project, developed as part of the SWitCH Dev Program—a prestigious Postgraduate degree in Software Development.

## Project Overview
Our team of ten dedicated developers brought this app to life over a semester, adhering to the Scrum methodology with a total of seven sprints. The backend, built in Java, supports REST and CLI controllers, while the frontend shines with React.

## Key Features
- **Location Configuration**: Easily set up your home’s location.
- **Room Management**: Add and customize rooms.
- **Device Integration**: Incorporate various devices into your rooms.
- **Sensor and Actuator Control**: Enhance devices with sensors and actuators for advanced functionality.

## Deployment and Local Setup
Currently, the app is hosted on the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP) servers. For a local setup:
1. Navigate to `frontend/smarthome`.
2. Open `.env.demo` and change the `REACT_APP_BACKEND_API_URL` variable to `http://localhost:8080`.
3. In a terminal, go to `frontend/smarthome`.
4. Ensure Node is installed, then run `npm start`.

Your app will launch in your browser, ready for you to explore and customize.
